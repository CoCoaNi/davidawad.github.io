===================

This is a simple project I made as a personal web page. I have been sharing it with friends family and potential employers to demonstrate my abilities as a Web Developer.

It also contains some other sites i'm working on as i use github for convenient testing of my sites. That's part of why the repo has so many commits.

##Thanks for Looking!##

###Thanks to Jacopo colo for the codebase of this website.
